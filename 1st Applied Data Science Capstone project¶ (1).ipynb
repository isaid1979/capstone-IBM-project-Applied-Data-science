    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Road Accident is the most undesirable and unexpected thing to occur to a road user, though they happen quite often. Unfortunately, we can see a minatory rise of road accidents, conspicuously highroad accidents over the past few years. It has a massive impact on society as well as in the economy of the country as there is an immense cost of fatalities and injuries. According to a recent report, annually on an average 9,000 lives have been taken by road accidents and lead to almost 28,000 injuries. This record indicates the idea to leverage the accident data that you found to predict the different accidents' severity and come up with solution which can be benefial to the governement. Besides this, according to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents to a developing country like us is 2-3% of GDP, which is a significant loss for a country like ours. Moreover, reducing this loss has become a great matter of concern for our country now.\n",

    "# 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "Say you are driving to another city for work or to visit some friends. It is rainy and windy, and on the way, you come across a terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. As you keep driving, police car start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. Oh, it is an accident and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the nearest hospital. They must be in critical condition for all of this to be happening. Now, wouldn't it be great if there is something in place that could warn you, given the weather and the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that you would drive more carefully or even change your travel if you are able to. Well, this is exactly what you will be working on in this course. So the problem statement here would be to come up with a project which canpredict the severity of an accident.\n",

    "TRAFFIC REPORT is based on data from 2004 to Present. The report states that \"Traffic volumes, speeds, and reported collisions are the three cardinal pieces of data traffic engineers and planners use to evaluate changes to Seattle streets.\n",

    "The ultimate project goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify dangerous locations\n",
    "Identify predictors of accidents (e.g., physical characteristics of the location, road condition, DUI, weather)\n",
    "Examine increase or decrease in number of accidents over time\n",
    "Identify predictors of increase or decrease in the number of accidents\n",
    "Recommend improvements on dangerous locations\n",

    "We recommend making a note of those questions as they may guide you through your project. You are welcome to answer any questions you are interested in using this dataset."

    "# 3. Data Description\n",
    "For the accurate prediction of the severity of accidents, a considerable number of traffic accident records with full information is required to train by using the proposed approaches. In this research work, the authors have collected a dataset from the Traffic Bureau that consists of total 37,885 traffic accidents recorded from the year 2007-2017. The entire dataset will split into two parts- Training Dataset and Test Dataset. 70% of the whole dataset has been chosen randomly by using a python library as a training data set and the remaining 30% has been used as our test dataset. We have used the 70-30 ratio for splitting dataset because of its proven accuracy.\n",
